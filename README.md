# Redfield Roleplay

A simple roleplay gamemode developed in 2016. This was my first attempt at developing a self-made game mode. It isn’t good and only served as a learning process.

⚠️ Note: Some systems of the gamemode could probably no longer working correctly and need to be updated.
Development and support have been discontinued; this upload serves mainly for archiving.   

Features:
